                      NEFERKA
                  </b></h2>
                    <p>
                      "Neferka" comes from the words beautiful (Nefer) & life force (Ka) in ancient Egyptian language. Each piece is a poetic combination glamor of metals and embodiment of a geometric order.
                      </p><p>
                      Neferka's elemental value is to carry the owner's consciousness to the present when wearing, touching, looking or using the pieces. Re-tuning our minds to 'here' and 'now', our experiences become significantly more attentive.
                      </p><p>
                      Pieces are based on scientific, philosophical and spiritual inheritances of different cultures. With a different idea nesting in their souls, they share Neferka's core value of appreciation of the present and seeing the poetry of the story that we are a part of.
                      </p><p>
                      The concepts are materialized with unique craftsmanship skills, by representers of hundreds of years old Armenian jewelry making traditions in Grand Bazaar, Istanbul.
